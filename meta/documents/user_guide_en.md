# IO – The cornerstone for plentymarkets template plugins

**IO** is the official logic plugin for the default online store of plentymarkets. In the new online store for plentymarkets, design and logic are separated from each other. Two plugins are required to integrate the online store into your plentymarkets system. The **plentyShop LTS** plugin contains the new standard design of the online store and can be customised to meet your needs. The **IO** plugin contains the logic part of the online store, is a general basis for all design plugins and can also be used by other plugins.

## Setting up IO in plentymarkets

The **IO** plugin only needs to be provisioned in plentymarkets. For further setup information, refer to the [plentymarkets manual](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/manual/main/online-store/setting-up-io.html).

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  It is absolutely essential, however, that <b>IO</b> is assigned the highest <b>Plugin position</b> (e.g. 999) via the <b>Set position</b> action in the plugin overview.

 **IO** is a required plugin for the **plentyShop LTS** template plugin.
